### Procedure

* Payment is expected on a monthly basis, at the first lesson of each month, before any lessons will be taught. Cheque and cash are accepted.

* I do not take any holidays, with the possible exception of an election day. Some students choose to take summers off, but this is not recommended for serious students.

* If you will be away during a regular lesson time, you should notify me before making that month's payment and I will subtract it from the total.

* Lessons that are missed with short notice (less than 24 hours) will not be made up, except in cases of illness. A student who is ill is not welcome in my studio and should stay home.

* I expect regular practice and serious effort from my students. I reserve the right to terminate my relationship with a student based on lack of dedication.

### Materials

* For practice, access to a piano is a necessity. For many students, an electric piano (with weight-sensitive keys) can be a suitable alternative to an acoustic piano.

* A metronome is a requirement. An electronic metronome is preferred. Although computer programs and mechanical metronomes are not as accurate as a electronic metronomes, they can be used in a pinch.

* I do not require students to purchase expensive volumes of music. For students who can afford it, it is a great option, but not a necessity. The music that I teach will be made available freely if requested. I do, however, require that my students keep their music well-organized. I don't want my students working with loose sheets.

* I do ask for each student to bring a notebook to every lesson.

### What to expect

* I do not, in general, teach music that is under copyright (in Canada), because I believe this to be unethical. While of course I will not stifle a student with a passion for a certain composition, I will never assign to a student a work that they cannot study or redistribute freely.

* I do not, in general, teach music of a religious or political nature, because I believe this to be unethical. Some of this music is beautiful, but there is a vast repertoire of great piano music available without it.
