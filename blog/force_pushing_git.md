If you're like me, you probably use git, and if you're like me, you probably use git badly. Years of working on projects by myself have ingrained in me a few habits that don't transfer well to team environments -- perhaps most notably, pushing (even force-pushing) to the master branch.

This post documents the steps I've taken to catch myself before this happens.

### Git hooks, briefly

A git hook is a program that can be run by git at various points in your git workflow. Typical examples include `pre-commit` (run before making a commit) and `post-checkout` (run after switching branches).

I'm not bothered by making bad commits -- in fact, I often do this on purpose to rebase later. What I'm trying to do is prevent *pushing* these bad commits, so I make a `pre-push` hook.

### Complete program text[^bash]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# don't allow --force-pushing to master branch

HOOK_NAME="hooks/$(basename $0)"
CUR_BRANCH=$(git name-rev --name-only --no-undefined --always HEAD)
PUSH_CMD=$(ps --pid $PPID --format "command=")
PROTECTED_BRANCHES="^(master|dev|release-*|patch-*)"

# putting regexes in quotes makes them fail, because bash ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if [[ "$CUR_BRANCH" =~ $PROTECTED_BRANCHES ]]; then
    if [[ "$PUSH_CMD" =~ force|delete|-f ]]; then
        echo -e "${HOOK_NAME}: don't force-push to $CUR_BRANCH"
        exit 1
    else
        echo -ne "${HOOK_NAME}: are you aware that you are on branch ${CUR_BRANCH}? "
        read yes < /dev/tty
        if [[ ! "$yes" =~ yes|y|Y ]]; then
            exit 2
        fi
    fi
fi
exit 0
```

### Explanation

The code is pretty short and straightforward, but there are a few things worth explaining:

#### Getting the current branch name

`git name-rev` exists to make getting the symbolic names of branches easy.

#### Reading from stdin

Bash hooks are not intended to run interactively. This is a problem if you are trying to write a confirmation ("are you sure?") program.

To circumvent this, read directly from `/dev/tty`.

#### Checking the command-line arguments

`pre-push` will be forked from the `git` command that you run. With this in mind, we can pass the parent process ID to `ps` and it will output the command that was run.[^proc]

#### Exit status

If a hook exits with a non-zero exit status, git won't follow through with the operation. I exploit this by exiting with `1` when we don't want to push, and `0` when we do.

### To set up

To apply this hook globally, to all current and future repos:

```
> cd ~
> mkdir -p .config/global_git_hooks/
> git config --global core.hooksPath .config/global_git_hooks
```

You can name your hooks directory whatever you want; here, I chose the name `.config/global_git_hooks/`. Save the file above as `pre-push` in the appropriate directory.

Ensure the file is executable:

```
> chmod +x ~/.config/global_git_hooks/pre-push
```

That's all it takes -- the program will be run every time invoke `git push`.

### Restoring the default behaviour

Sometimes, you might want the default behaviour. No problem! `cd` into the repository and edit the local config with `git config core.hooksPath $GIT_DIR/hooks`. This will override your global and allow custom settings on a repo-per-repo basis.

### What if I know what I'm doing and I really want to anyway?

You can skip the execution of hooks with `git push --no-verify`. Best of luck with that.

[//]: # footnotes

[^bash]: I don't always use bash, but the regex match operator (`=~`) was too convenient to refuse.
[^proc]: My first instinct was to read from `/proc`, but this turned out to be more difficult than running `ps`.
