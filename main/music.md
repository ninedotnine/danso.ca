This is where my music lives.

I've been playing many styles of piano for some 20 years now, and it's recently culminated in a Master of Music degree from the University of Ottawa. I've since moved to Montreal to pursue further graduate studies.

I perform recitals, fundraisers, and private events. I also accompany voice and instrumentalists for auditions, performances, and the like. [Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.

Maybe you want to inquire about [lessons](/music/lessons)?
