HACKER:

: noun. *A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness.*

-- Richard Stallman, [*Free Software, Free Society*](https://shop.fsf.org/books-docs/free-software-free-society-selected-essays-richard-m-stallman-3rd-edition) 

I like to make things. All of my software is [free](https://www.fsf.org) and open-source, and most is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/danso) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ninedotnine).

I somehow once earned an undergraduate degree in computer science.

You can read about some of the [projects](/hacking/projects) that I've worked on.
