I am generally best contacted [by email](mailto:contact@danso.ca). Other ways to keep in touch:

* Catch me on the fediverse: [@danso@mtl.rocks](https://mtl.rocks/danso).
* I host my projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/danso).
* I like to call my friends using [Tox](https://tox.chat). If we're not already contacts, you will need to ask me for my Tox ID.
* I regularly read [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) and can be [contacted there](https://lobste.rs/u/danso).
* IRC users will often find me idling on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) as danso.

Historical:

* I no longer use [GitHub](https://github.com/ninedotnine).
* I (rarely) use Fosstodon to share software things: [@danso@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@danso).
* I've moved my Mastodon activity away from [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@danso), but you may still enjoy my posts there.
* I still have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ninedotnine) account, but the Fediverse is just better.
* You can solicit me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-so/), or whatever people use LinkedIn for.
