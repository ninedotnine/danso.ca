#### mads

[mads](https://gitlab.com/danso/mads) (*Mutt Alias Danabase Server*) is a server designed to be used with [mutt](http://mutt.org/) for managing an email contact database.

#### happy-space

[happy-space](/blog/happy-space/) is a command-line calculator for a whitespace-sensitive expression language. It is a demo implementation of a language in which space characters alter the semantics of expressions.

View the code or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/ninedotnine/happy-space).

#### Under the Weather

As a participant in ConUHacks 2017, I wrote [Under the Weather](https://gitlab.com/danso/under-the-weather) in Python with a partner in under 24 hours. We made a bot that reports the weather in any major city in the world over Mastodon. It uses the excellent [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API as well as [Mastodon.py](https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Mr. Prickles

[Mr. Prickles](https://gitlab.com/danso/mrprickles) is a bot for the [Tox](https://tox.chat) network written in C using the toxcore library. It maintains its own list of contacts and can make or accept audio/video calls.

He mostly just hangs out and doesn't do much, but he's super helpful for debugging. 

#### Bugfree Computing Machine

[Bugfree Computing Machine](https://gitlab.com/danso/bugfree-computing-machine)
was my senior project for my undergraduate degree with the oversight of Prof. Christopher Lanz. I built an emulator, linker, and assembler for the hypothetical Extended Stack Machine, a pedagogical architecture cooked up by Prof. Timothy Fossum. 

It was written entirely in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), so it is naturally bug-free.

#### Quoridor

[Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) is a cute board game for 2 to 4 players. I worked with a fantastic team to build Quoridor in Java over one semester. 

[Our implementation](https://github.com/softe-teams-quoridor/quoridor) can be played over a network and includes a GUI and an AI opponent. I was responsible for the networking code as well as much of the game's internal logic. I also fixed many bugs.

#### Funtimes

[Funtimes](https://github.com/ninedotnine/funtimes) is a command-line game engine written in Python with a partner. Originally intended to be a remake of a game we used to play in high school, it evolved into a system for building new games using our homemade domain-specific language.

#### dwmstatus

I use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) on my personal machine, and it seems every dwm user has their own status program. Mine is written in C and I like to think that it is pretty good. 

#### danso.ca

Indeed, I even made this website. It's generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and the full source code is publicly viewable on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/danso/danso.ca).
